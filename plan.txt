----- NOTES -----

* Each team should update the table of contents and table of figures as they work on the report

* Document work on self contained sorting scripts

* Have each MEMBER create a branch everytime they do work
    - merge branches back into main

* Focus on Git and GitHub, not algorithm optimization
